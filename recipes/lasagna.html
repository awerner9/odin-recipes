        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>½ pound ground pork</li>
            <li>½ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>Onion</li>
            <li>Canned tomatoes</li>
            <li>Two tablespoons of parsley</li>
            <li>One clove of garlic</li>
            <li>A dash of sugar</li>
            <li>Dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper</li>
            <li>Noodles</li>
            <li>Cottage cheese, Parmesan, and shredded mozzarella.</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly. Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt, oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li>Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until they're al dente.</li>
            <li>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley, the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Layer the ingredients according to the recipe (starting with sauce and ending with mozzarella) until the lasagna is assembled.</li>
            <li>Cover with foil and bake in the preheated oven for about half an hour. Remove the foil and continue baking until the top is golden brown.</li>
            <li>In an oven preheated to 375 degrees F, this homemade lasagna should be perfectly baked in about 50 minutes (30-40 minutes covered, 5-10 minutes uncovered).</li>
        </ol>
